# kapwa_ui

**Kapwa** is a simple microblogging app with bare-bones social media features such as Login and Registration, 256-character posts, recent feed (timeline), likes, commenting, and much more.

This repo only contains the front-end prototype and is written mostly in HTML and CSS, with some dependencies for Bootstrap and Font Awesome added.

I'm planning to take this prototype and build the backend with PHP and Laravel.
